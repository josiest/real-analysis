\section{Continuity}

\begin{enumerate}

\item If $f$ is defined on $E$, the \textit{graph} of $f$ is the set of points
      $(x, f(x))$ for $x \in E$ or $E \times f(E)$. In particular, if
      $E \subset \R$ and $f: E \to \R$, then the graph of $f$ is a subset of
      the plane ($\R^2$)

Suppose $E$ is compact. Prove that $f$ is continuous on $E$ if and only if its
graph is compact.

\begin{proof}
Let's first suppose that $f$ is not continuous so there's some $p \in E$ where
$\lim_{x\to p} f(x) \neq f(p)$.

Let $\{p_n\} \to p$ be some sequence of $E$ so that
$\{ f(p_n) \} \to y \in \overline{f(E)}$ where $y \neq f(p)$. Then
$\{ (p_n, f(p_n)) \}$ is an infinite subset of the graph of $f$ which has no
limit point in the graph. This must mean the graph is not compact.

Now suppose that $f$ is continuous. Since $E$ is compact then $f(E)$ is
also compact, and it's trivial to show the cartesian product of two compact sets
is also compact.

\end{proof}
